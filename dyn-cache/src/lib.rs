//! Caches for storing the results of repeated function calls. The caches
//! use minimal dynamic dispatch to store arbitrarily many
//! types of query results in a single store.
//!
//! Cache storage is indexed by dynamic [scopes](#scopes):
//!
//! ```
//! let storage = dyn_cache::local::SharedLocalCache::default();
//!
//! // scopes can be identified by ~anything Eq + Hash
//! let a_scope = 'a';
//! let b_scope = 'b';
//!
//! // we use interior mutability here to demonstrate query side effects
//! let count = std::cell::Cell::new(0);
//! let increment = |&to_add: &i32| -> i32 {
//!     // let's pretend that there's some other interesting work happening here...
//!     let new = count.get() + to_add;
//!     count.set(new);
//!     new
//! };
//!
//! // now we'll define some "queries" to the cache
//! let a_inc = |n| storage.cache(&a_scope, &n, &increment);
//! let b_inc = |n| storage.cache(&b_scope, &n, &increment);
//!
//! assert_eq!(count.get(), 0, "haven't called any queries");
//!
//! assert_eq!(a_inc(1), 1);
//! assert_eq!(count.get(), 1, "called 'a'(1) once");
//!
//! assert_eq!(a_inc(1), 1);
//! assert_eq!(count.get(), 1, "called 'a'(1) twice, only ran once");
//!
//! assert_eq!(b_inc(2), 3);
//! assert_eq!(count.get(), 3, "called 'a'(1) and 'b'(2)");
//!
//! assert_eq!(a_inc(1), 1, "retains cached value");
//! assert_eq!(count.get(), 3, "queries only affect their own scope");
//!
//! assert_eq!(a_inc(2), 5);

//!
//! assert_eq!(a_inc(1), 6, "only the most recent revision is cached");
//! assert_eq!(count.get(), 6);
//! ```
//!
//! A single cache instance can hold multiple types of [scope](#scopes):
//!
//! ```
//! let storage = dyn_cache::local::SharedLocalCache::default();
//! let count = std::cell::Cell::new(0);

//! // each of these queries has a different type of scope
//! // and while the inputs/outputs are the same they could also
//! // vary without interfering with each other
//! let one_inc = |n| storage.cache(&one_scope, &n, increment);
//! let two_inc = |n| storage.cache(&two_scope, &n, increment);

//!
//! # Cache types
//!
//! There are two main flavors of cache available for use in this crate:
//!
//! | Shared type                 | Synchronized? |
//! |-----------------------------|---------------|
//! | [`sync::SharedSendCache`]   | Mutex         |
//! | [`local::SharedLocalCache`] | RefCell       |
//!
//! These variants are used by calling [`sync::SharedSendCache::cache_with`] or
//! [`local::SharedLocalCache::cache`].
//!
//! The shared cache types above are implemented by wrapping these "inner"
//! types:
//!
//! | Mutable type          | Requires `Send`? |
//! |-----------------------|------------------|
//! | [`sync::SendCache`]   | yes              |
//! | [`local::LocalCache`] | no               |
//!
//! These "inner" caches require mutable access to call their functions like
//! [`local::LocalCache::get`] which returns either a reference or a
//! [`CacheMiss`] that can be passed back to the cache in
//! [`local::LocalCache::store`] to initialize a value in the cache:
//!
//! ```
//! let mut cache = dyn_cache::local::LocalCache::default();
//! let scope = &'a';
//! let arg = &1;
//!
//! let miss = cache.get(scope, arg).expect_err("first access will always be a miss");
//! let (entry, result): (_, Vec<usize>) = miss.init(|&n| {
//!     let v: Vec<usize> = vec![n; n];
//!     (v.clone(), v)
//! });
//! cache.store(entry);
//! assert_eq!(result, vec![1usize]);
//!
//! let result: &Vec<usize> = cache.get(scope, arg).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(result, &vec![1]);
//! ```
//!
//! See [`sync::SendCache::get`] and [`sync::SendCache::store`] for the
//! thread-safe equivalents.
//!
//! The shared variants are defined by wrapping these inner cache types in
//! reference counting and synchronized mutability.
//!
//! # Query types
//!
//! Each query type maps to a typed "namespace" within the unityped cache
//! storage, each query having a distinct type each for its scope, input, and
//! output.
//!
//! ## Scopes
//!
//! The scope of a query is its identifier within cache storage for the given
//! input & output types. Scopes must implement `Eq` and `Hash` so that results
//! can be efficiently and uniquely indexed.
//!
//! Each scope identifies 0-1 `(Input, Output)` pairs in each namespace. The
//! same type of scope can be used in multiple queries without collision if
//! the types of inputs, outputs, or both differ.
//!
//! ## Inputs
//!
//! The input to a query determines when it is re-run. If a given query is
//! present in the cache then the previous input is compared to the new input.
//! If the input hasn't changed, the query can be skipped and its
//! previously-stored output is returned.
//!
//! ## Outputs
//!
//! The only constraint on query outputs is that they are owned (`Output:
//! 'static`). This imposes the inconvenient requirement that all access to
//! stored values occurs during the scope of a closure (similar to thread-locals
//! in the standard library).
//!
//! The most common way to work around this requirement is to choose output
//! types that cheaply implement [`std::clone::Clone`].
//!
//! # Allocations
//!
//! In order to store distinct query results in the same container, allocations
//! and indirection are required.
//!
//! ## Borrowed query parameters
//!
//! All of the cache functions accept a reference to a type `Key:
//! ToOwned<Owned=Scope>` so that the scope is only cloned on the first
//! insertion to its storage and all subsequent lookups can be with a borrowed
//! type.
//!
//! Like the query scope, functions to get cache values accept a borrowed
//! version of the input and only clone it when the input has changed.
//!
//! ## Causes
//!
//! There are three situations where these caches allocate:
//!
//! 1. caching new types which haven't been seen by that cache instance yet
//! 2. storing the results of a new query
//! 3. updating the results of a stored query
//!
//! There are several types of allocations performed by the caches in this
//! crate:
//!
//! | Allocation                         | Causes        |
//! |------------------------------------|---------------|
//! | box a new, empty namespace         | (1)           |
//! | resize a cache's map of namespaces | (1)           |
//! | call `.to_owned()` on a scope/key  | (2)           |
//! | resize a namespace's storage       | (2)           |
//! | call `.to_owned()` on an input/arg | (2), (3)      |
//! | update an output's dependents      | (1), (2), (3) |
//!
//! Outside of these, only user-defined functions should perform any allocation.
//!
//! # Garbage Collection
//!
//! All of the caches have a `gc()` method which retains only used values. A
//! value is used if it or a value which depends on it has been used/rooted
//! since the last call to `gc()`.
//!
//! ## Rooting
//!
//! When a cache read *fails*, we expect that the value will be populated
//! immediately after and a new node in the dependency graph is created. The new
//! dependency node is marked as an incoming dependent on any cache values which
//! are accessed during the initialization of the new value. The new node is
//! then marked as a "root" for the garbage collector once it has
//! been initialized and the cache populated. If in subsequent epochs the rooted
//! value is accessed again it will be re-rooted and its dependents will be
//! marked as live even if they were not directly accessed in that epoch.
//!
//! When a cache read *succeeds*, its dependency node is marked as being
//! depended upon by the node (if any) which was being initialized during the
//! read, linking the two dependencies together.
