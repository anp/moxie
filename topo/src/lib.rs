//! `topo` creates a hierarchy of nested scopes represented as stable
//! identifiers referring to the function callgraph.
//!
//! Each scope in this hierarchy has a unique and deterministic [crate::Id]
//! describing that environment and the path taken to arrive at its stack frame.
//! These identifiers are derived from the path taken through the callgraph to
//! the current location, and are stable across repeated invocations of the same
//! execution paths.
//!
//! By running the same topologically-nested functions in a loop, we can observe
//! changes to the structure over time. The [moxie](https://docs.rs/moxie) crate uses these identifiers and
//! environments to create persistent trees for rendering human interfaces.
//!
//! # Making functions nested within the call topology
//!
//! Define a topologically-nested function with the `topo::nested` attribute:
//!
//! ```
//! #![feature(track_caller)]
//!
//! #[topo::nested]
//! fn basic_topo() -> topo::Id {
//!     topo::Id::current()
//! }
//!
//! #[topo::nested]
//! fn tier_two() -> topo::Id {
//!     basic_topo()
//! }
//!
//! // each of these functions will be run in separately identified
//! // contexts as the source locations for their calls are different
//! let first = basic_topo();
//! let second = basic_topo();
//! assert_ne!(first, second);
//!
//! let third = tier_two();
//! let fourth = tier_two();
//! assert_ne!(third, fourth);
//! assert_ne!(first, third);
//! assert_ne!(first, fourth);
//! assert_ne!(second, fourth);
//! ```
