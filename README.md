`moxie` (<small>/ˈmäksē/</small>) is a lightweight platform-agnostic UI runtime written in Rust, powering a strongly-typed declarative programming style with minimal interaction latency.

`moxie` is principally inspired by [React][react] and more specifically the recent [Hooks API][hooks]. It aims to smoothly bridge the gap between stateless tools like [dear imgui][dear] and "traditional" UI paradigms with manually managed graphs of stateful, mutable objects. There are many interesting parallels in our design to those of recently announced UI frameworks [Jetpack Compose][compose] and [SwiftUI][swiftui], although a more in-depth comparison hasn't yet been made. Also, in the course of looking for prior art (_ahem_ googling "memoized imgui"), I found a very interesting [thread on LtU](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4561) discussing various commenters' efforts and curiosities -- it's a fun read.

## Contributing

The project is not yet ready for external contributions, although I hope to change this message before RustConf 2019 (we'll see!). In the meantime, I'm currently trying out a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vTAzk3d) for chat and will continue working towards the project's maturity enough to onboard!
