//! Every HTML element is a member of one or more content categories â€” these
//! categories group elements that share common characteristics. This is a loose
//! grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these
//! categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared
//! behavior and their associated rules, especially when you come upon their
//! intricate details. It's also possible for elements to not be a member of any
//! of these categories.
//!
//! There are three types of content categories:
//!
//! 1. Main content categories, which describe common rules shared by many
//!    elements.
//! 2. Form-related content categories, which describe rules common to
//!    form-related elements.
//! 3. Specific content categories, which describe rare categories shared
//!    only by a few elements, sometimes only in a specific context.
